The Digital Communication Methods Lab is located at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research, part of the University of Amsterdam. The lab brings together existing and new projects with digital communication methods as its cornerstone. The lab aims at expanding innovative work on methods, analyses, and scientific practices critical to Communication Science, including work on mobile communication and AI, not only as research topics, but also as data collection modes.

Lab members meet regularly to discuss their work and to develop their skills using and studying digital research methods. The lab hosts workshops on various topics, for example, on general programming skills, agent-based modeling or using Virtual Reality for research. Furthermore, it connects researchers working at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research to other initiatives related to digital methods within and outside of the University of Amsterdam.
