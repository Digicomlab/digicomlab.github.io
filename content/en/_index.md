The lab has over 80 members working both at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research and at other institutes. Members include starting PhD candidates to senior researchers. They come together regularly to discuss their work and develop their skills using and studying digital research methods. The lab hosts workshops on various topics, for example, on general programming skills, agent-based modeling or using Virtual Reality for research.
