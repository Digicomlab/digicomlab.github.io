On 27 June, the Digicomlab hosts a Digital Methods Fair at ASCoR. During this fair, several researchers working at the lab pitch their projects. There are booths providing information about the usage of several digital methods, such as eye tracking and AI for communication research. Joining this event is an excellent opportunity for networking and for getting to know what research is currently going on at the lab!
