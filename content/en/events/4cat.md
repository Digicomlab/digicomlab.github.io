On 25 February, [Stijn Peeters](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/p/e/s.c.j.peeters/s.c.j.peeters.html) demonstrated the 4CAT tool. 4CAT is an open-source application developed at the UvA to facilitate the collection and processing of data from social media platforms. The tool can be accessed through a web interface, which means no programming is required. However, for researchers with programming knowledge, 4CAT offers the possibility to add new data sources and custom processing.
