This is an example paragraph. The image should float to the right and the text should wrap around it.

{{< floatimage src="https://digicomlab.github.io/profile_pic/panel.jpg" alt="Floating Image" width="384" height="203" >}}

More text to demonstrate the text wrapping around the image. This should wrap nicely around the floated image to the right.



The lab organises several events to connect researchers working on/with digital research methods. An overview of events organised by the lab can be found here.
