This is the introduction to my document. Here's an image that should float to the right.

{{<img class="float-right" width="384" height="203" src="https://digicomlab.github.io/profile_pic/panel.jpg" alt="Floating Image">

As you can see, the text continues here and should wrap around the image. Adding more text will show how the wrapping works.

<style>
    .float-right {
        float: right;
        margin: 0 0 10px 10px; /* Adds some space around the image */
    }
</style>}}


The lab organises several events to connect researchers working on/with digital research methods. An overview of events organised by the lab can be found here.
