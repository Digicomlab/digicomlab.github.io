During the last member-meeting of the academic year, [Lara Wolfers](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/o/l.n.wolfers/l.n.wolfers.html) and [Susanne Baumgartner](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/b/a/s.e.baumgartner/s.e.baumgartner.html) hosted a session on the usage of [Experience sampling methods (ESM)](https://digicomlab.github.io/projects/07-esm/). They shared their insights into the advantages and challenges associated to this method as well as information on analysing the data that can be gathered through this method. Accompanied by several examples from their own work, this meeting was a very good opportunity for those interested to learn more about the method!
