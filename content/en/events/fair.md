At the end of the academic year, the Digicomlab hosted a Digital Methods Fair at ASCoR. During this fair, several researchers working at the lab pitched their projects. There were booths providing information about the usage of several digital methods, such as eye tracking and AI for communication research. Through this event, researchers and students interested in digital research method got to know more about the work done by the lab and connected with others to start new projects!
