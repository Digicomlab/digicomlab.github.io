In this talk, Prof. Judith Möller will discuss the use of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), for accessing information on current events and how this is evolving. Drawing on findings from a conjoint experiment and a representative population survey, she will examine the credibility of LLM-generated information and disparities in their usage. Looking ahead, her talk will reflect on the broader implications of these developments for democratic processes and the challenges and opportunities they present for fostering an informed society.

Judith Möller is Professor of Empirical Communication Research with a focus on Media Use and Social Media Effects at Universität Hamburg, in collaboration with the Leibniz Institute for Media Research | Hans-Bredow-Institut (HBI). Her joint appointment combines teaching at the University’s Institute of Journalism and Communication Studies with leading research at HBI. Her work explores the effects of political communication, particularly on social media, focusing on personalized political messaging and the role of new media in shaping opinion and political socialization.
