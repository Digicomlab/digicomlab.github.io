In October 2024, [Saurabh Khanna](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/s.khanna/s.khanna.html) and [Irene van Driel](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/r/i.i.vandriel/i.i.van-driel.html) introduced Digicomlab members to PictoPercept: A tool designed to assess societal biases and perceptions. This tool is based on visual survey methods and available [here](https://pictopercept.streamlit.app/). It presents users with two images of different individuals and asks them to select one of these images. Embedding this task in different questions and instructions allows scholars to capture sensitive societal perceptions and the potential biases that people hold. Researchers can both use and contribute to the tool by proposing new survey questions. This way, PictoPercept facilities a collaborative, adaptive, and inclusive data collection method.
