Do social media algorithms contribute to the spread of misinformation? Does YouTube radicalize its users? Are Google search results fostering gender biases? These are the kind of questions that research evaluating algorithmic systems - or: algorithm auditing - is trying to address. In this talk, taking place in September, key findings of such work will be highlighted.

Social simulations can be used at the hypothesis formation stage, applied for analyzing cases that are difficult to study in an ethically acceptable way, or can help to fill gaps in the causal inferences. Hence, they are increasingly popular among social scientists and can be a valuable tool to add to their toolkit!
