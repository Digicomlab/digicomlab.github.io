Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (VR) are novel techniques which provide an immersive experience to the user. Whereas in VR the real world is completely replaced for a virtual one, in AR virtual aspects are added to the real-world environment.

Augmented Reality enables consumers to try out (virtual) furniture in their own living room, turn their living room into a game of Minecraft, replace their TV by projecting the screen on their wall, and even virtually transport themselves to another room. This technology superimposes virtual objects (text, pictures, video, or 3D graphics) upon the physical world, via websites, smartphone applications, digital screens, or wearable devices. AR apps change the way people perceive and interact with virtual objects, because they use a real time, interactive, 3D view of the physical world, overlaid with virtual objects. As such, AR allows consumers to interact with virtual objects as if they are real, physical objects.

In Virtual Reality, users are completely immersed into the computer simulated environment: they have the perception of being present in the virtual environment and not in their actual physical environment. Due to this strong sense of presence in the virtual world, it is thought that stimuli provided in this world elicit similar responses and behaviour as in real-life. Because of this, the technique has potential as a research tool for investigating effects of (traditional) media on affective and cognitive responses and behavior, but also as a means to convey messages through a virtual-world experience.
