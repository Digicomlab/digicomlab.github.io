title: "Eye Tracking"

---

Eye tracking is a method whereby individuals' eye movements are tracked during a study. This can be done using various set-ups. In its most basic form, an eye tracker is connected to a computer screen and monitors people's eye movements as they are using the computer. A more complex form is an eye tracker that is embedded within a set of glasses. While wearing the glasses, individuals can move around freely and in any setting while their visual attention to people and objects is tracked.


The following project is using/studying this method:
