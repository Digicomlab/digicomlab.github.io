title: "Eye Tracking"

---

Eye tracking is a method whereby individuals' eye movements are tracked during a study. This can be done using various set-ups. In its most basic form, an eye tracker is connected to a computer screen and monitors people's eye movements as they are using the computer. A more complex form is an eye tracker that is embedded within a set of glasses. While wearing the glasses, individuals can move around freely and in any setting while their visual attention to people and objects is tracked.
