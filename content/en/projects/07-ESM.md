title: "Experience Sampling Methods (ESM)"

---


Experience Sampling Methods are methods whereby individuals are asked to report their experiences, emotions, or opinions at multiple intervals. These intervals can be based on fixed periods of time, or they can be event based. In the former example, individuals receive a request to answer questions at a fixed time, such as every evening at 21:00 hrs. An example of the latter is when individuals are asked to answer a set of questions every time that they used a specific medium. By surveying individuals multiple times for a longer period, researchers can gain detailed insights in their opinions, experiences, and behavior.


The following projects are using/studying this method:
