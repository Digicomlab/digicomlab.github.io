Researchers affiliated to the Digicomlab work on digital research methods and aim to advance these methods to increase their usage within communication science. The methods that we focus on are: 

- AI in communication
- Augmented and Virtual Reality Applications
- Computational Text Analysis Methods (CTAM)
- Automated Analysis of Visual Data
- Conversational Agents and AI
- Data Donation
- Eye Tracking
- Physiological Responses in Communication
- Experience Sampling Methods


To support research on these methods, we fund projects through our Seed Funding Grants and our Thesis Grants.
