title: "Physiological Responses in Communication"

---



Emotions play a central role in understanding communication effects. Within the domain of politics, for instance, Europeans have been described as experiencing anxiety in response to the number of refugees entering their country; angry about unresponsive political elites and sad about how immigrants are treated. To answer the question whether communicated messages influence the emotions citizens’ experience, the state-of-the-art predominantly relies primarily upon self-reported emotions. Yet, when asked to self-report emotions, people are likely to mix their initial emotion with their cognitive evaluation which raises the question whether we are measuring the actual emotion or a cognitive evaluation.

The Digital Communication Lab conducts innovative research by not only relying upon self-reported emotions but measuring emotions via the actual physiological responses that citizens experience. Physiological responses are automatic, directed by the autonomous nervous system, when the brain experiences emotion. Using these physiological measures, researchers within the Digital Communication Lab explore how citizens respond to political messages that they agree and disagree with, the affective orientations of citizens’ attachment to political parties and their leaders and individual differences in the proclivity to respond to differentially framed messages.
