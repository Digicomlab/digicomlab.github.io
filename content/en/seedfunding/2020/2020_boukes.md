An often-researched question is whether online debate between citizens lives up to the democratic standards of a deliberative public sphere (e.g., Freelon, 2015; Jaidka, Zhou, & Lelkes, 2019). However, previous studies remained rather descriptive on the presence of certain speech elements. We instead want to investigate the following research question: How do online discussions take shape and what kind of user-comments may evoke subsequent comments of a higher/lower deliberative quality? To answer this RQ, we analyze the content of these posts using supervised machine learning and statistically model how discussions evolve over time to predict how certain types of response may influence the nature of later posted user-comments.
