Comments written in response to social media content can tell a lot about how people experience this content. The present project uses social media comments to detect users’ entertainment experiences in response to social media messages. It does so by analyzing the comments posted in response to emotional corporate films in particular. This way, the project adds to the methods that scholars have to measure viewers’ experiences of online entertainment content. In addition, by comparing this novel way of measuring entertainment experiences to more established methods for measuring entertainment experiences (i.e., surveys), the project advances our methodological understanding of different approaches to studying entertainment experiences.

The following publication resulted from this project:
