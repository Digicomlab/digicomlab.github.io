Messaging services such as WhatsApp potentially play a role for sharing
political information via meso-spaces between public and private. However, it is
difficult to tell in how far WhatsApp IS being used for news, especially in
European contexts since data access so far has been very tedious and poses many
privacy-related challenges. Data donation allows researchers to access such
otherwise inaccessible data sources. In this project, we combine two existing
open-source infrastructures:
[WhatsApp Explorer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01328) to help respondents
retrieve their own data and
[PORT](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05596) to donate that data to
researchers. In a pilot study we will investigate whether and if so which links
to news are being shared via WhatsApp.
