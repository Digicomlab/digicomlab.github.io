This project investigates how dashboards can make research findings more accessible to non-experts, journalists, policymakers, and the general public. While open-science initiatives have made datasets publicly available, technical barriers often prevent broader engagement. To address this, we develop **dashboardr**, an open-source R package that enables researchers with basic R skills to create professional, interactive dashboards with minimal technical effort. By transforming data into intuitive visual narratives, these dashboards bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact, supporting transparency, outreach, and public engagement.

For this project, we are working closely with Alexandra Pafford, who supports us as a research assistant in the development of the package.

Notable examples of dashboards that inspire this project include:

* [AlgoSoc’s AI Opinion Monitor](https://monitor.algosoc.org/en/) by Fabio Votta and Ernesto de León, which visualizes survey data on Dutch public opinion regarding AI.
* [CampAIgn Tracker](https://www.campaigntracker.de/) by Fabio Votta, which visualizes AI-generated content in political communication during the 2025 German election.
