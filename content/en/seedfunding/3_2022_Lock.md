Anecdotal evidence shows that news articles visualize AI repeatedly as stylized humanoid robots or brains, speaking to technologyâ€™s anthropomorphization. While AI frames have been studied in news texts, content analyses of AI images are lacking. The way news media visually frame AI purports multiple sociotechnical imaginaries of how the reader is supposed to envision the future. However, we miss systematic knowledge about how news media visually frames AI. This project uses images from open source and commercial editorial image databases to build a classifier that categorizes pre-defined frames in images of AI to be applied to analyses of news or social media.
