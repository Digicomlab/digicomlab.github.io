Climate change is posing an increasing threat to nature, animal species, and humans. To combat climate change, individuals play an important role by behaving climate friendly and by engaging in interpersonal communication regarding climate change in order to create support for societal and governmental changes. Research so far mostly focuses on stimulating climate friendly behavior, whereas stimulating interpersonal climate change communication is so far largely overlooked. The question, therefore, is: how can we stimulate people to talk about climate change? We will investigate whether a Virtual Reality experience regarding climate change stimulates interpersonal climate change communication. Furthermore, we will look into the role of emotions and arousal as underlying mechanisms.
