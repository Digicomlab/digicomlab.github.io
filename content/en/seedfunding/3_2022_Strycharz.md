#### By Joanna Strycharz and Joseph Yun

Studying attitudes has been crucial in communication and advertising theory development; measurement of attitudes has had a substantial impact on several contexts, including research on advertising effectiveness and consumer reactanceIn recent research, it has been acknowledged that while attitudes are important for beliefs and behavior, strong attitudes have a greater impact on individualâ€™s intentions and behaviors. Thus, both attitude and attitude strength take an important role in communication and advertising research. In the proposed study, we aim to investigate how attitude and attitude strength measurements can be improved in the context of digital communication.
