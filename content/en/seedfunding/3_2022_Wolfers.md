#### By Lara Wolfers and Susanne Baumgartner

With the deeper integration of digital media into everyday life, the popularity of Experience Sampling Methods (ESMs) in communication science has surged. For ESMs, it is essential to keep the length of daily questionnaires as short as possible. Thus, constructs are often assessed with one item. However, even for key communication constructs, no validated one-item measures are available. The aim of this project is to validate one-item measures for key communication constructs for use in ESM. We will identify central communication science construct, select suitable items for these constructs, and validate these items in an ESM study.
