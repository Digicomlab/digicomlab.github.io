This project will adopt psychological profiling by predicting consumers’ personality based on their text from Twitter; this will be done with a machine learning (ML) algorithm. In addition, we will aim is to investigate the validity of this personality classifier. This will be achieved by comparing the algorithmic scores to self-reported personality scores. Taking the self-report as a golden standard, we will be able to draw conclusions regarding the accuracy and validity of the algorithm in predicting people’s personality based on social media data. As such, it can prove to be a valid substitute for personality assessment.
