Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Once people experience the consequences of climate change (e.g., a heat wave or a flood), they are more likely to perceive climate change as an actual threat and are, therefore, more likely to act in a pro-environmental manner. We posit that Virtual Reality (VR) offers an innovative manner to allow people to experience the consequences of climate change (e.g., experiencing a flood). In this project, we investigate what emotional responses (e.g., fear, anger) can be triggered by such a VR experience, measured using psychophysiological measures. Via ecological momentary assessment on participants’ smartphones we study how these emotions can subsequently influence pro-environmental behaviors over time.
