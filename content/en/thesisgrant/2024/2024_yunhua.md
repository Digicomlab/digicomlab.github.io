This project investigates how AI vs Human influencers on Instagram impact social media users' mental health and health behaviours. Focusing on fitspiration content, it examines their effects on mood, dietary restrictions, and exercise habits. Using the experience sampling method (ESM), participants receive daily fitspiration posts from either an AI or human influencer for one week, with self-reported assessments of mood, diet, exercise, and parasocial relationships. By capturing data in natural environments, this study provides a dynamic understanding of how parasocial bonds and health behaviors evolve. Findings aim to deepen insights into parasocial relationship theory, clarify AIâ€™s role in health communication, and inform social media-based public health strategies.
