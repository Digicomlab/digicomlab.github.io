This project investigates the emergence of post truth dynamics within the Subreddit r/politics between 2007 and 2024. We analyze two parallel evolutions: the gradual shift from sharing mainstream news toward alternative media sources and the rising intensity of emotional language. 
By utilizing a fine tuned SBERT Transformer model, the study detects nuanced changes in sentiment and emotional intensity across millions of user interactions. We explore whether active presidential campaigns drive users away from factual legacy outlets toward ensationalized content. Ultimately, this research illuminates the growing tension between objective information and affective polarization in digital public spheres.
